## Why do I need a Note taking Application, you ask? The answer to this question is extensive, so I'll stick to the main ideas...
- Provides a way to help organize your day, week, month or even year!
- Not using your brain to remember every little task you need to do frees it up for more important stuff. Like... say... software develpoment...
- Makes it easy for busy parents and all other kinds of adults to keep track of those pesky "honey-do" lists so you can get back to binging Netflix!

## Installation
In order to create this Note Taker app, I had to download the following:
- Node.js. This is the runtime environment I used in conjunciton with my IDE to code this project. You can download the current version of node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en)

- Once node.js is installed, you have to install the uuid package with npm. Version 4.

## In-Summary
The mind is a slippery place. It's often hard to remember every little task we need to do, so now you only need to remember this one thing: Use this app!.
